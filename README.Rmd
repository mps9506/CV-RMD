```{r setup, include=FALSE}

```


This repository contains my resume and CV. R scripts for generating each file are also included. The R script utilizes information maintained in Google Sheets and Zotero reference manager database to help automate document updates. This approach is heavily based on the [datadrivencv](https://github.com/nstrayer/datadrivencv) and [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) packages.
